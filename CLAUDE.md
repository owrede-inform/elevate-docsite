## Licensing Considerations
- Do not offer the site with an MIT license. The project actually has no license at all.
- Remember to commit, push, merge and deploy, when I enter "/deploy" as command.
- The "site" is the GitHub page at https://owrede-inform.github.io/elevate-docsite/
- Remmber to reuse the dev server that is already started at localhost:3000 (if it is running) and avoid spawning many new servers withouth need!
