## Licensing Considerations
- Do not offer the site with an MIT license. The project actually has no license at all.
- Remember to commit, push, merge and deploy, when I enter "/deploy" as command.
- The "site" is the GitHub page at https://owrede-inform.github.io/elevate-docsite/
- Remmber to reuse the dev server that is already started at localhost:3000 (if it is running) and avoid spawning many new servers withouth need!
- Always read the documentation and the API for each ELEVATE component before you try to use it. For instance you tried to generate different buttons with the variant-Attribute while the actual attribute is "tone". Without thouroughly reading and investigating the API you will not be able to use ELEVATE.
- Try to use ELEVATE Components if possible. Read the real API from the installed package elevate-core-ui first and undertand the API. Never rely on information in the /data folder as specification. If it was requested to use an ESDS component instead of the ELEVATE component, thatn remember that and keep that override permanent.
- If you want to use an ELEVATE Component, always read the API documentation in the elevate-core-ui package first.
