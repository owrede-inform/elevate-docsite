<PageDescription>

The ELEVATE Design System is built on four fundamental principles that guide every design decision, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and user-centricity across all INFORM software experiences. These principles reflect our commitment to creating enterprise-grade applications that serve our users' complex workflows with clarity and efficiency.

## 1. Accessibility First

Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's fundamental to how we design. Every component, pattern, and guideline is created with accessibility as a core requirement.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" aspectRatio="16:9" caption="Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels">
  
  ```html
  <button aria-label="Close dialog">
    <CloseIcon />
  </button>
  ```
  
  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" aspectRatio="16:9" caption="Rely solely on visual cues for important information">
  
  ```html
  <div class="red-text">Error occurred</div>
  ```
  
  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Key Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** – All components meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation** – Every interactive element is keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support** – Proper semantic markup and ARIA labels throughout
- **Color Contrast** – Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text and background colors

## 2. Consistency

Consistent experiences reduce cognitive load and build user confidence. Our design system provides standardized components, patterns, and guidelines that work harmoniously together.

### Visual Consistency

- **Typography Scale** – Consistent typographic hierarchy across all interfaces
- **Color Palette** – Carefully curated colors with defined usage guidelines
- **Spacing System** – Standardized spacing tokens for predictable layouts
- **Component Library** – Reusable components that behave consistently

### Behavioral Consistency

- **Interaction Patterns** – Standard behaviors for common actions
- **Navigation Models** – Consistent navigation paradigms
- **Feedback Systems** – Uniform success, error, and loading states

## 3. User-Centricity

Every design decision prioritizes user needs and context. We design for real people solving real problems, considering their goals, constraints, and diverse abilities.

### Human-Centered Approach

- **Task-Oriented Design** – Components support complex enterprise workflows efficiently
- **Context Awareness** – Interfaces adapt to different user roles and business contexts
- **Inclusive Design** – Solutions work for users with diverse technical backgrounds and abilities
- **Domain Expertise** – Designs respect the specialized knowledge of logistics and optimization professionals

### Design for Enterprise Scale

- **Progressive Disclosure** – Complex business data presented in manageable, hierarchical views
- **Responsive Design** – Seamless experiences from mobile devices to large control room displays
- **Performance Focus** – Optimized for data-intensive applications and real-time decision making
- **Scalability** – Interfaces that handle thousands of data points without compromising usability

## 4. Systematic Thinking

ELEVATE is more than a collection of components—it's a cohesive system where every element relates to the whole.

### Design Tokens

Our design tokens ensure consistency at scale:

```css
/* INFORM Brand Colors */
--elevate-primary: #0090a7;      /* INFORM Petrol */
--elevate-secondary: #004759;    /* INFORM Dark Green */
--elevate-success: #10b981;      /* Success Green */
--elevate-error: #ef4444;        /* Error Red */
--elevate-warning: #f59e0b;      /* Warning Amber */

/* ELEVATE Spacing Scale (4px base) */
--elvt-measures-spacing-2xs: 0.25rem;   /* 4px */
--elvt-measures-spacing-xs: 0.5rem;     /* 8px */
--elvt-measures-spacing-s: 0.75rem;     /* 12px */
--elvt-measures-spacing-m: 1rem;        /* 16px */
--elvt-measures-spacing-l: 1.5rem;      /* 24px */
--elvt-measures-spacing-xl: 2rem;       /* 32px */

/* Typography with Inter Variable Font */
--elvt-primitives-font-family-default: 'Inter', sans-serif;
--elvt-primitives-font-family-mono: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
```

### Component Relationships

- **3-Tier Architecture** – Primitive tokens → Semantic aliases → Component-specific implementations
- **Composition Over Configuration** – Flexible Web Components that combine naturally
- **Shared Dependencies** – Common design tokens and patterns reduce maintenance overhead
- **Web Standards** – Built with Lit Element for framework-agnostic integration

## Applying These Principles

When creating new components or patterns for INFORM software:

1. **Start with accessibility** – Consider all users, including those using assistive technologies in enterprise environments
2. **Follow established patterns** – Use existing ELEVATE components and INFORM brand conventions
3. **Test with domain experts** – Validate assumptions with logistics professionals and actual user workflows
4. **Think systematically** – Consider how new elements fit the broader ELEVATE ecosystem and INFORM product suite
5. **Design for data density** – Enterprise applications often require displaying complex information efficiently
