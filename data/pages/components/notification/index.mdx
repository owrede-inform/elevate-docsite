## Overview

Notifications are essential for communicating important information to users in a timely and non-intrusive manner. ELEVATE notifications maintain consistency in design and behavior while providing flexibility for different message types and contexts.

### When to Use Notifications
- **System feedback**: Confirming actions, reporting errors, or status updates
- **Important alerts**: Security warnings, system maintenance, or critical issues
- **Progress updates**: Long-running operations or background processes
- **Informational messages**: Tips, announcements, or contextual help

## Types

### Success Notifications
Confirm successful completion of user actions or system processes.

<LiveExample
  title="Success Notifications"
  htmlCode={`<elvt-notification type="success" title="Changes Saved">
  Your profile updates have been successfully saved.
</elvt-notification>

<elvt-notification type="success" title="Upload Complete" dismissible>
  All 5 files have been uploaded successfully.
  <elvt-button slot="action" size="small">View Files</elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>`}
/>

### Error Notifications
Alert users to problems that require attention or corrective action.

<LiveExample
  title="Error Notifications"
  htmlCode={`<elvt-notification type="error" title="Upload Failed">
  Unable to upload file. Please check your internet connection and try again.
</elvt-notification>

<elvt-notification type="error" title="Authentication Error" dismissible>
  Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue.
  <elvt-button slot="action" size="small" variant="primary">Log In</elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>`}
/>

### Warning Notifications
Inform users about potential issues or situations requiring caution.

<LiveExample
  title="Warning Notifications"
  htmlCode={`<elvt-notification type="warning" title="Storage Almost Full">
  You're using 95% of your available storage space.
</elvt-notification>

<elvt-notification type="warning" title="Unsaved Changes" dismissible>
  You have unsaved changes that will be lost if you leave this page.
  <elvt-button slot="action" size="small">Save Changes</elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>`}
/>

### Info Notifications
Provide helpful information or updates that enhance user understanding.

<LiveExample
  title="Info Notifications"
  htmlCode={`<elvt-notification type="info" title="New Feature Available">
  We've added dark mode support. Check it out in your settings.
</elvt-notification>

<elvt-notification type="info" title="Maintenance Scheduled" dismissible>
  System maintenance is scheduled for tonight from 2-4 AM EST.
  <elvt-button slot="action" size="small">Learn More</elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>`}
/>

## Usage

### Notification Positioning
Notifications can be positioned strategically based on context and importance:

```html
<!-- Inline notifications within content -->
<elvt-notification type="info" title="Tip" inline>
  Use keyboard shortcuts to work more efficiently.
</elvt-notification>

<!-- Toast notifications for immediate feedback -->
<elvt-notification type="success" title="Saved" toast duration="3000">
  Your changes have been saved automatically.
</elvt-notification>

<!-- Persistent notifications for important alerts -->
<elvt-notification type="warning" title="Action Required" persistent>
  Please verify your email address to continue using all features.
</elvt-notification>
```

### Auto-Dismiss Behavior
Configure automatic dismissal based on message importance:

<LiveExample
  title="Auto-Dismiss Notifications"
  htmlCode={`<!-- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds -->
<elvt-notification type="success" title="Operation Complete" duration="5000">
  The backup process finished successfully.
</elvt-notification>

<!-- Manual dismiss required -->
<elvt-notification type="error" title="Critical Error" dismissible>
  Unable to connect to server. Please contact support.
</elvt-notification>

<!-- No dismiss option (use sparingly) -->
<elvt-notification type="warning" title="System Alert">
  Scheduled maintenance in progress.
</elvt-notification>`}
/>

### Actions and Interactions
Include relevant actions to help users respond to notifications:

<LiveExample
  title="Notification Actions"
  htmlCode={`<elvt-notification type="info" title="Update Available" dismissible>
  A new version of the application is ready to install.
  <div slot="action" style="display: flex; gap: 0.5rem;">
    <elvt-button size="small" variant="primary">Update Now</elvt-button>
    <elvt-button size="small" variant="secondary">Later</elvt-button>
  </div>
</elvt-notification>

<elvt-notification type="warning" title="Connection Lost" dismissible>
  Your internet connection appears to be unstable.
  <elvt-button slot="action" size="small">Retry Connection</elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>`}
/>

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- Keep messages concise and actionable
- Use appropriate notification types for message urgency
- Provide clear actions when user response is needed
- Group related notifications to avoid overwhelming users
- Test notifications with screen readers

**DON'T:**
- Overuse notifications for non-essential information
- Use notifications for content that belongs in the main UI
- Auto-dismiss error messages too quickly
- Stack too many notifications simultaneously
- Use notifications without clear dismiss mechanisms

## Accessibility

Notifications must be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies:

### Screen Reader Announcements
- Notifications are announced immediately when they appear
- Message content and type are clearly communicated
- Action buttons are properly labeled and accessible
- Auto-dismiss timing allows sufficient reading time

### Keyboard Navigation
- All notification actions are keyboard accessible
- Dismiss buttons can be activated with Enter or Space
- Tab order flows logically through notification content
- Focus management considers notification appearance and dismissal

### Visual Accessibility
- Sufficient color contrast for all notification types
- Icons supplement color coding for accessibility
- Text sizing meets accessibility guidelines
- Motion and animations respect user preferences

<LiveExample
  title="Accessible Notification Features"
  htmlCode={`<!-- Proper ARIA labeling -->
<elvt-notification 
  type="success" 
  title="Form Submitted" 
  role="alert"
  aria-live="polite"
  dismissible>
  Your contact form has been submitted successfully. We'll respond within 24 hours.
  <elvt-button 
    slot="action" 
    size="small"
    aria-label="Close notification">
    <elvt-icon icon="mdi:close" aria-hidden="true"></elvt-icon>
  </elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>

<!-- High priority alert -->
<elvt-notification 
  type="error" 
  title="Security Alert" 
  role="alert"
  aria-live="assertive"
  persistent>
  Suspicious login attempt detected from unknown device.
  <elvt-button slot="action" size="small">Review Activity</elvt-button>
</elvt-notification>`}
/>
