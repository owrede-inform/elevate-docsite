## Overview

Navigation patterns help users understand where they are, where they can go, and how to get there efficiently.

- **Mobile first**: Ensure navigation works on all devices

## Coming Soon

- **Primary Navigation**: Header navigation and main menu patterns
- **Secondary Navigation**: Sidebar, tabs, and contextual navigation
- **Breadcrumbs**: Path indicators and navigation aids
- **Mobile Navigation**: Drawer, hamburger, and responsive patterns
